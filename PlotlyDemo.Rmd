First Slide
========================================================


## This html shows a Plot of the mtcars dataset in r. The graph is generated using plotly.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
{knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = F)} 

```


```{r date, echo=FALSE}
date()
```

Slide with a Plot of weight vrs mpg, color by cylinder and size by horse power
========================================================
```{r library, echo=FALSE}
# summary(mtcars)
library(plotly)
library(webshot)
```
```{r hp, echo=FALSE} 
plot_ly(mtcars, x = mtcars$wt , y = mtcars$mpg, mode = "markers",
        color = as.factor(mtcars$cyl), size = mtcars$hp)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
