## R Markdown

This html shows a Plot of the mt cars dataset in r.
The graph is generated using plotly.


```{r date, echo=FALSE}
date()
```

```{r library, echo=FALSE}
# summary(mtcars)
library(plotly)
```

## Plot of weight vrs mpg, color by cylinder and size by horse power


```{r hp, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = mtcars$wt , y = mtcars$mpg, mode = "markers",
        color = as.factor(mtcars$cyl), size = mtcars$hp)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
